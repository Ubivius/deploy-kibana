Kibana is an free and open frontend application that sits on top of the Elastic Stack, providing search and data visualization capabilities for data indexed in Elasticsearch.

## Usage

Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

$ helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
$ helm repo update
```

## Installing the Chart

```console
$ helm install kibana --version <version> elastic/kibana -f chart/values.yaml
